# Trivium-asic
A Verilog implementation of the Trivium stream cipher. This repo is an evolution starting from a fork of the [Trivium project](https://github.com/FuzzyLogic/Trivium) by Christian P. Feist. The current project aims to build an ASIC implementation of the cipher with a serial link.

## 1. General Information
+ This Verilog implementation of the Trivium stream cipher consists of:
    - The core components
    - A testbench for simulation
    - A Python reference implementation for the generation of test vectors and possibly other scenarios
+ The interface of the core is through a serial link, provided by an FPGA or microcontroller.
+ The hdl/src directory contains the source code of the core, whereas the testbench can be found in hdl/tb
+ Test vectors and the python reference implementation can be found in the reference_implementation/ directory
+ The specification of Trivium can be found in [1]
	
## 2. Current Status
Work in progress. At this point, RTL files need to be adapted to ASIC specifications.
    
## 3. Synthesizing and Testing The Core
Work in progress. 

+ Synthesis
    - All necessary code will be found in the hdl/src directory
+ Testing (**NOT DONE YET**)
    - The testbench for the behavioral simulation can be found in hdl/tb
    - Running the test requires two files that contain the test vectors
    - The test vector files can be generated by executing the script reference_implementation/trivium_py.py
    - The test vectors consist of randomly generated input (trivium_ref_in.txt) and corresponding encrypted
      outputs (trivisum_ref_out.txt)
    - Be sure to copy these test vector files to the directory of the project that runs the testbench if you
      are using Xilinx ISE or include them in the project in case of Vivado
    - The testbench is self checking and will abort with a success message if all tests pass
    - Create a simple Zynq design with a single Zynq 7 Processing System core and use the bare-metal 
      test code found in sw/basic_test
